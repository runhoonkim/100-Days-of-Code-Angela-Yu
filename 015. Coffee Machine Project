#TODO 4: Check resources sufficient?
#TODO 4-1: When the user chooses a drink, the program should check if there are enough resources to make that drink.
#TODO 4-2: E.g. if Latte requires 200ml water but there is only 100ml left in the machine.
# It should not continue to make the drink but print: “Sorry there is not enough water.”
#TODO 4-3: The same should happen if another resource is depleted, e.g. milk or coffee.

#TODO 5: Process coins.
#TODO 5-1: If there are sufficient resources to make the drink selected,
# then the program should prompt the user to insert coins.
#TODO 5-2: Remember that quarters = $0.25, dimes = $0.10, nickles = $0.05, pennies = $0.01
#TODO 5-3: Calculate the monetary value of the coins inserted.
# E.g. 1 quarter, 2 dimes, 1 nickel, 2 pennies = 0.25 + 0.1 x 2 + 0.05 + 0.01 x 2 = $0.52

#TODO 6: Check transaction successful?
#TODO 6-1: Check that the user has inserted enough money to purchase the drink they selected.
# E.g Latte cost $2.50, but they only inserted $0.52 then after counting the coins
# the program should say “Sorry that's not enough money. Money refunded.”.
#TODO 6-2: But if the user has inserted enough money, then the cost of the drink gets added to the machine as the profit
# and this will be reflected the next time “report” is triggered.
# E.g.
# Water: 100ml
# Milk: 50ml
# Coffee: 76g
# Money: $2.5
#TODO 6-3: If the user has inserted too much money, the machine should offer change.
# E.g. “Here is $2.45 dollars in change.” The change should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

# Water: 300ml
# Milk: 200ml
# Coffee: 100g
# Money: $0
# Report after purchasing latte:
# Water: 100ml
# Milk: 50ml
# Coffee: 76g
# Money: $2.5
#TODO 7-2: Once all resources have been deducted, tell the user “Here is your latte. Enjoy!” if latte was their choice.
