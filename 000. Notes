-. Debugging SMTP Connection Error
1. Make sure you've got the correct smtp address for your email provider:
  Gmail: smtp.gmail.com
  Hotmail: smtp.live.com
  Outlook: outlook.office365.com
  Yahoo: smtp.mail.yahoo.com

If you use another email provider, just Google for your email provider e.g. "Gmail SMTP address"

-. google python mail password
aoci aakb ltkb mfqw

-. SMTP Port
By default smtplib.SMTP uses port 25. This used to be the standard SMTP port, but because of abuse in the past most servers nowadays have blocked this port to external traffic. 
There are still some that do allow it; Hotmail, Live, etc. Port 25 is still used for traffic between servers, but many providers have switched to using port 587 for external traffic. 
If in doubt, search the internet for "smtp server settings" for your provider.
Add a port number by changing your code to this:
smtplib.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com", port=587)
